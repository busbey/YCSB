YCSB is a framework for benchmarking systems. By itself, it is not particularly useful; only when you add code to interface with a data serving system is it useful. The source tree currently contains code to interface with HBase and Cassandra, but it is straightforward to interface with other database systems - see [[Adding a Database]].
