YCSB is a framework for benchmarking systems. By itself, it is not particularly useful; only when you add code to interface with a data serving system is it useful. The source tree currently contains code to interface with HBase and Cassandra, but it is straightforward to interface with other database systems - see [[Adding a Database]].

h3. To obtain YCSB source

<PRE>
  git clone git://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB.git
</PRE>

h3. To build the basic package

YCSB requires java 1.6 to build.

<PRE>
  cd YCSB
  ant
</PRE>

h3. To build HBase and Cassandra database layers

First, you must obtain the HBase and Cassandra clients.<P>
  * HBase: <A HREF="http://hadoop.apache.org/hbase/">http://hadoop.apache.org/hbase/</A> - YCSB has been built with version 0.20.3.
  * Cassandra: <A HREF="http://cassandra.apache.org/">http://cassandra.apache.org/</A> - YCSB has been built with version 0.6.

After downloading the client files, copy the jars into YCSB/src/com/yahoo/ycsb/db/lib/. The db/ directory contains all code for interacting with external databases, and the db/lib/ directory should contain jars for building the connector code. For example:

<PRE>
  cd hbase-0.20.3/lib/
  cp *.jar ../../../YCSB/src/com/yahoo/ycsb/db/hbaselib/
</PRE>

and 

<PRE> 
  cd apache-cassandra-0.6.1/lib/
  cp *.jar ../../../YCSB/src/com/yahoo/ycsb/db/cassandralib/
</PRE>
