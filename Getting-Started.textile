YCSB is a framework for benchmarking systems. By itself, it is not particularly useful; only when you add code to interface with a data serving system is it useful. The source tree currently contains code to interface with HBase and Cassandra, but it is straightforward to interface with other database systems - see [[Adding a Database]].

h3. To obtain YCSB source

<PRE>
  git clone git://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB.git
</PRE>

h3. To build the basic package

YCSB requires java 1.6 to build.

<PRE>
  cd YCSB
  ant
</PRE>

h3. To build HBase and Cassandra database layers

First, you must obtain the HBase and Cassandra clients.<P>
  * HBase: <A HREF="http://hadoop.apache.org/hbase/">http://hadoop.apache.org/hbase/</A> - YCSB has been built with version 0.20.3.
  * Cassandra: <A HREF="http://cassandra.apache.org/">http://cassandra.apache.org/</A> - YCSB has been built with version 0.6.

After downloading the client files, copy the jars into YCSB/src/com/yahoo/ycsb/db/cassandralib/ and hbaselib/. The db/ directory contains all code for interacting with external databases, and the cassandralib/ and hbaselib/ directories should contain jars for building the connector code. For example:

<PRE>
  cd hbase-0.20.3/
  cp hbase-0.20.3.jar ~/YCSB/src/com/yahoo/ycsb/db/hbaselib/
  cd lib/
  cp *.jar ~/YCSB/src/com/yahoo/ycsb/db/hbaselib/
</PRE>

and 

<PRE> 
  cd apache-cassandra-0.6.1/lib/
  cp *.jar ~/YCSB/src/com/yahoo/ycsb/db/cassandralib/
</PRE>

Now, you can use the dbcompile-* targets to build each connector.

<PRE>
  cd ~/YCSB/
  ant
  ant dbcompile-hbase
  ant dbcompile-cassandra
</PRE>

At the end of this process, the ycsb.jar file in the build/ directory will contain all the classes needed to run YCSB, as well as the Cassandra and HBase connector classes.

Of course, if you don't want both HBase and Cassandra, you can just build one or the other. 

h3. Now, run a workload
